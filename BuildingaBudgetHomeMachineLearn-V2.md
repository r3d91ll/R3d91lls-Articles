# Building a Budget Home Machine Learning Lab with an NVIDIA P40 GPU

As machine learning continues to gain traction in various industries, having access to powerful hardware can be a game-changer for researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike. However, the cost of high-end GPUs and dedicated servers can be prohibitive, especially for those on a tight budget. And paying by the token, well those charges will add up quickly and as a result can slow your learning down after it has emptied your account. In this tutorial, we'll explore how I built a cost-effective home machine learning lab by repurposing an used NVIDIA P40 GPU and using it with a consumer-grade motherboard.

Introduction

The NVIDIA P40 is a professional-grade GPU designed for data centers and workstations. While it may not be the latest or most powerful GPU on the market, it still packs a decent punch for machine learning tasks, making it an excellent choice for those looking to build a budget-friendly setup.
<talk more about the P40, when it was produced what its cuda core and tensoror core counts are as well as what one can expect out of the performance. we should also discuss why being able to at least off-set the cost of tokens by only sending work to the public AI that you cant do locally. >
One of the key advantages of the P40 is its availability on the second-hand market at relatively low prices. With a bit of patience and some hunting, you can often find these GPUs for a fraction of their original cost.

Hardware Requirements

To get started, you'll need the following components:

1. **NVIDIA P40 GPU**: Scour online marketplaces or local classifieds for a used NVIDIA P40 GPU. Make sure to inspect the condition and test the GPU before making a purchase.

2. **Consumer-grade Motherboard**: Look for a compatible motherboard that can accommodate the P40 GPU. Many consumer-grade motherboards from reputable brands like ASRock, ASUS, or Gigabyte can work with the P40, provided they have a suitable PCIe slot and sufficient power delivery.

3. **CPU**: Choose a CPU that meets your performance requirements and is compatible with your selected motherboard.

4. **RAM**: Opt for a reasonable amount of RAM (e.g., 16GB or more) to handle your machine learning workloads.

5. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Ensure that your PSU can provide enough power for your CPU and GPU combination. The P40 has a TDP of 250W, so a 600W or higher PSU is recommended.

6. **Storage**: Depending on your needs, you can choose an SSD or HDD for storage.

7. **Cooling Solution**: While the P40 comes with a blower-style cooler, you may want to consider a [custom fan shroud and additional fans] for better cooling and noise reduction.

8. **Operating System**: We'll be using Ubuntu 22.04 in this tutorial, but you can choose your preferred Linux distribution.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install the Operating System**: Start by installing Ubuntu 22.04 on your system. You can follow the official Ubuntu installation guide for instructions.

2. **Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: Once Ubuntu is set up, you'll need to install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and the corresponding GPU drivers. Follow these steps:

    ```bash
    # Update package lists
    sudo apt-get update

    # Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
    sudo apt-get -y install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

    # Add CUDA to PATH
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

    # Reboot the system
    sudo reboot
    ```

3. **Configure Fan Control**: Since the P40 GPU fans are connected directly to the motherboard, we'll need to set up fan control to manage noise levels and ensure proper cooling. Here's how:

    Create a systemd service file:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/gpu-fan-control.service
    ```

    Add the following contents:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=GPU Fan Control Service
    After=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/etc/gpu-fan-control.sh
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Create the `gpu-fan-control.sh` script:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/gpu-fan-control.sh
    ```

    Add the following contents:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Path to the hwmon device and fan control file
    hwmon_path="/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1"
    fan_control_file="$hwmon_path/pwm5"
    fan_speed_input_file="$hwmon_path/fan5_input"

    # Log file path
    log_file="/var/log/gpu-fan-control.log"

    # Temperature thresholds (adjust as needed)
    high_temp_threshold=70
    low_temp_threshold=60

    # Fan speed adjustment step (percentage) and minimum fan speed
    fan_speed_step=10
    min_fan_speed=75
    max_fan_speed=255 # Ensure fan speed does not exceed max value

    while true; do
        # Get the current time
        current_time=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

        # Get the current GPU temperature
        gpu_temp=$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=temperature.gpu --format=csv,noheader)

        # Read the current fan speed setting and input RPM
        current_fan_speed_setting=$(cat "$fan_control_file")
        current_fan_speed_rpm=$(cat "$fan_speed_input_file")

        # Calculate new speed
        if [ "$gpu_temp" -gt "$high_temp_threshold" ]; then
            new_speed=$((current_fan_speed_setting + (max_fan_speed * fan_speed_step / 100)))
        elif [ "$gpu_temp" -lt "$low_temp_threshold" ]; then
            new_speed=$((current_fan_speed_setting - (max_fan_speed * fan_speed_step / 100)))
        else
            new_speed=$current_fan_speed_setting
        fi

        # Ensure new speed is within min and max bounds
        new_speed=$(($new_speed < $min_fan_speed ? $min_fan_speed : $new_speed))
        new_speed=$(($new_speed > $max_fan_speed ? $max_fan_speed : $new_speed))

        # Apply the new fan speed
        echo "$new_speed" | sudo tee "$fan_control_file" > /dev/null

        # Log current time, GPU temp, fan speed setting, and RPM
        echo "$current_time, GPU Temp: $gpu_tempÂ°C, Fan Speed Setting: $new_speed, Fan RPM: $current_fan_speed_rpm" | sudo tee -a "$log_file" > /dev/null

        # Delay before checking again
        sleep 2
    done
    ```

    Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /etc/gpu-fan-control.sh
    ```

    Reload systemd, start, and enable the service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl start gpu-fan-control
    sudo systemctl enable gpu-fan-control
    ```

4. **Install Machine Learning Frameworks**: Depending on your preferences, you can install popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras using your distribution's package manager or by following the official installation guides.

5. **Test Your Setup**: Once everything is installed and configured, you can test your machine learning setup by running some sample models or benchmarks. This will ensure that your GPU is properly detected and utilized by the machine learning frameworks.

Congratulations! You've successfully built a budget-friendly home machine learning lab using a repurposed NVIDIA P40 GPU and a consumer-grade motherboard. With this setup, you can experiment with various machine learning models, train neural networks, and gain valuable hands-on experience without breaking the bank.

Conclusion
