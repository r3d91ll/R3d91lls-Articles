## Introduction

This document summarizes a conversation about designing an advanced code retrieval system using concepts from Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Mixture of Agents (MoA) architectures. The discussion evolved from a basic layered approach to a sophisticated hybrid system, concluding with a practical implementation strategy.

## Initial Approach: Layered Vector Store

The initial design involved a layered vector store approach:

1. File-level layer
2. Class-level layer
3. Function-level layer

Each layer would have its own embedding and chunking strategy. This approach aimed to provide context-aware retrieval based on the query type.

## Chunking Strategies

We discussed various chunking strategies for code:

1. Syntactic Chunking: Breaking code at logical boundaries (functions, classes, methods)
2. Sliding Window: Overlapping chunks to maintain context
3. Hierarchical Chunking: Chunking at multiple levels (file, class, function)

The proposed approach combined these strategies:

- Primary Chunking: At function/method level
- Secondary Chunking: File-level and class-level for broader context
- Flexible Max Length: Configurable based on specific needs

## Mixture of Agents (MoA) Approach

We explored a Mixture of Agents approach, which included:

1. File-level Agent
2. Class-level Agent
3. Function-level Agent
4. Query Analysis Agent

This architecture was visualized as follows:

## Hybrid MoA-MoE Architecture

We then discussed a hybrid approach combining Mixture of Agents (MoA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE):

1. Top-level Agents (MoA):
   - Code Structure Agent
   - Semantic Understanding Agent
   - Query Intent Agent

2. Within each Agent (MoE):
   - Specialized experts for different aspects of code understanding

This hybrid architecture was illustrated as:

## Practical Implementation Strategy

Considering resource constraints, particularly in terms of compute power and training data, we devised a practical implementation strategy:

1. Utilize existing open-source MoE LLMs
2. Implement the system with pre-trained models
3. Collect interaction data during usage
4. Use collected data for future fine-tuning or training of custom experts

The strategy was visualized as follows:

### Implementation Steps

1. Select an Open Source MoE LLM (e.g., Mixtral 8x7B, BTLM-3B-8x)
2. Implement the Code Retrieval System
3. Set up User Interaction and Data Collection
4. Implement Data Storage and Processing
5. Establish a Feedback Loop for Iterative Improvement
6. Prepare for Future Fine-tuning

### Implementation Considerations

- Prompt Engineering
- Vector Store Integration
- Monitoring and Analytics
- Ethical and Privacy Considerations
- Scalability

This approach allows for starting with a sophisticated system using pre-trained models while building towards a more customized solution in the future.
